# Hash

## Goals

* Familiarize yourself with the selected, important methods here.
* Know that a `Hash` should be used whenever you have keys and values.
* Know:
  * how to access a value by key
  * how to set a value for a key
  * how to delete a key/value

## What's a Hash?

A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs. You can think of a hash like an
array, but instead of the keys being incrementing integer indices (i.e., 0, 1,
2, 3, etc.), the keys are arbitrary, and can be any kind of object. From ruby 1.9.3
onwards, Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted.

You can create a hash a couple different ways:

```ruby
empty_hash = Hash.new
another_empty_hash = {} # shorter and preferred

capitals = { 'New York' => 'Albany', 'California' => 'Sacramento' }
```

### `Hash#[]`

We can look up values in a hash by its key:

```ruby
capitals = { 'New York' => 'Albany', 'California' => 'Sacramento' }
capitals['New York'] # => 'Albany'
```

### `Hash#.each`

We can also *iterate* over the elements of the hash, just like we did
with array:

```ruby
capitals = { 'New York' => 'Albany', 'California' => 'Sacramento' }

capitals.each do |state, capital|
  puts "#{capital} is the capital of #{state}"
end

# => Albany is the capital of New York
#    Sacramento is the capital of California
```

Notice that when we iterate over a hash, each entry in the hash has
both a key and a value.

### `Hash#[]=`

We add a new key and value to a hash like so:

```ruby
capitals = { 'New York' => 'Albany', 'California' => 'Sacramento' }
capitals['Texas'] = 'Austin'

puts capitals
# => { 'New York' => 'Albany', 'California' => 'Sacramento', 'Texas' => 'Austin' }
```

### `Hash#delete`

We can delete a key/value pair in a hash like so:

```ruby
capitals = { 'New York' => 'Albany', 'California' => 'Sacramento' }
capitals.delete('California')

puts capitals
# => { 'New York' => 'Albany' }
```

(Or we can opt to use the Hash#delete_if method to iterate through the hash while 
deleting everything that returns true for a given expression.)

```ruby
test_hash = {'a' => 100, 'b' => 25}
test_hash.delete_if {|key, value| value <= 50} 
puts test_hash
# => {'a'=>100}
```


### `Hash#merge`

We can also merge two hashes together:

```ruby
capitals = { 'New York' => 'Albany', 'California' => 'Sacramento' }
more_capitals = { 'Texas' => 'Austin', 'Alaska' => 'Fairbanks' }

capitals.merge(more_capitals)
# => { 'New York' => 'Albany', 'California' => 'Sacramento', 'Texas' => 'Austin', 'Alaska' => 'Fairbanks' }
```

Notice that `hash1.merge(hash2)` is the same as `hash2.merge(hash1)`
here. This isn't always the case; if you have two hashes with the same
keys, duplicate entries in the merged Hash take precedence over the
ones in the calling Hash:

```ruby
h1 = {:a => 'apple', :b => 'bat'}
h2 = {:b => 'bravo', :c => 'charlie'}

h1.merge(h2) # => {:a => 'apple', :b => 'bravo', :c => 'charlie'}    
```

Note also that `merge` does not modify either of the hashes, it
creates a new hash which contains the keys and values of both. There
is a bang version (`merge!`) which will modify the hash.

### `Hash#keys`

If we want to get all of the keys in a hash we can use the `keys`
method:

```ruby
capitals = { 'New York' => 'Albany', 'California' => 'Sacramento' }

capitals.keys # => ['New York', 'California']
```

Notice that the return value of this method is an *array* of the
hash's keys.

### `Hash#values`

Similarly, we can get all of the values in a hash by using the
Hash#values method:

```ruby
capitals = { 'New York' => 'Albany', 'California' => 'Sacramento' }
capitals.values # => ['Albany', 'Sacramento']
```

### `Hash#has_key?`

We can check if a hash has a specific key by using the `Hash#has_key?`
method:

```ruby
capitals = { 'New York' => 'Albany', 'California' => 'Sacramento' }
capitals.has_key?('New York') # => true
capitals.has_key?('France') # => false
```

### Set

In Math a Set is an exlusive list of numbers. Examples are the best way to show this.

{3,5,6} is a set. 
{3,5,6,6} is not. 

In a set, order does not matter. So, {5,3,6} is the same as the one above. So, you can see, the actual index or order of these numbers do not matter, as they would were they to be held in an array. 


Ruby provides a class named `Set`. You can read all about it in the
[ruby-doc][ruby-doc]. Let's make a set of methods that will manipulate
a `Hash` as if it were a `Set`.  Like so:

```ruby
# Note these should be safe methods (no !)
set_add_el({}, :x) # => {:x => true}
set_add_el({:x => true}, :x) # => {:x => true} # This should automatically work if the first method worked
set_remove_el({:x => true}, :x) # => {}
set_list_els({:x => true, :y => true}) # => [:x, :y]
set_member?({:x => true}, :x) # => true
set_union({:x => true}, {:y => true}) # => {:x => true, :y => true}
set_intersection # I'm not going to tell you how the last two work
set_minus # Return all elements of the first array that are not in the second array, not vice versa
```

Note: true is just used as a placeholder value. 

We could have defined a class named `Set`, and these methods would
have been instance methods. We don't define a new class here because I
want you to see how you can do this with just methods, and hijack the
Ruby `Hash` class to represent your set.

### Hash offset

Martha has created a hash with letter symbols as keys to represent items that start with their keys. However, she realized everything is off by one letter.

```ruby
wrong_hash = { :a => "banana", :b => "cabbage", :c => "dental_floss", :d => "eel_sushi" }
```
Write a program `hash_correct` that takes this wrong hash and returns the correct one.

### Counting with hashes!

Experiment by writing a couple of short programs that will use Hashes to count objects by incrementing a key value.
