## Test-First Ruby (Alex Chaffee)

[Test-First Ruby][test-first-ruby] is a great way to test your Ruby
knowledge. It gives you interactive feedback, so you can find and
correct mistakes. It will also give you practice running RSpec tests
(complete level 1 of [CodeSchool's RSpec course][codeschool-rspec] if
you need a refresher on RSpec).

The required exercises are 0-12 and 14. To begin work, go to the
github page and click to download the ZIP file. Extract the ZIP and
open the contained index.html. This will contain further instructions
as to how to proceed.

When you're finished with Test First Ruby, send it to us (instructions
below).

## Event Manager (JumpstartLabs)

[Event Manager][event-manager] is a tutorial that walks you through
writing your first Ruby program. Work through the tutorial, writing
code. **Type the code yourself** instead of copy and pasting; that way
you'll remember the commands better.

When you've finished building the Event Manager, send it to us
(instructions below).
