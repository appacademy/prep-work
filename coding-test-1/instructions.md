# Coding Challenge I

## Description

We would like applicants to do a short coding challenge as part of
their application. The coding challenge is a brief (up to 45 minutes)
test of basic programming knowledge. If you already know Ruby (or
Python), you shouldn't need to prepare much.

**The coding challenge is meant to be accessible to everyone.** Many
of our applicants have never programmed before. If you don't have
prior coding experience, we link resources below to review; we also
summarize exactly what you'll need to know to be ready for the
challenge. Completing the challenge without prior experience is a
great way for your application to stand out, and demonstrates your
perseverance and commitment.

## When should I take the test?

The test will take up to 45 minutes. Please have time set aside so
that you can complete the test unhurried by other commitments.

Do **take your time in preparing for the test** so that you may do
your best. There is no hurry. You may take it whenever you like.

## What programming language do I write in?

We have designed the test in Ruby, which is the language of Rails.

You may also answer the challenge in Python, if you choose. If you do
not know Python, please complete the challenge in Ruby.

If you know another language and would strongly prefer to answer in
that, please contact [us](mailto:admissions@appacademy.io).
