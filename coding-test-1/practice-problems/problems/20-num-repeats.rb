# Write a method that takes in a string and returns the number of
# letters that appear more than once in the string. You may assume
# the string contains only lowercase letters. Count the number of
# letters that repeat, not the number of times they repeat in the
# string.
#
# Difficulty: hard.

# your solution, they should all print true.
