# Write a method that takes a string and returns true if it is a
# palindrome. A palindrome is a string that is the same whether written
# backward or forward. Assume that there are no spaces; only lowercase
# letters will be given.
#
# Difficulty: easy.

def palindrome(string):
  pass

# These are tests to check that your code is working. After writing
# your solution, they should all print true.

print 'palindrome("abc") == False: ' + str(palindrome('abc') == False)
print 'palindrome("abcba") == True: ' + str(palindrome('abcba') == True)
print 'palindrome("z") == True: ' + str(palindrome('z') == True)
