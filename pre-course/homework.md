This prepwork constitutes a basic introduction to programming designed to be
accessible to everyone. It contains some selected readings to bring you up to
speed on Ruby, plus some exercises for you to complete. All told, we expect the
prepwork to take about 15hrs.

We believe that the time you invest in learning Ruby will be time well spent:
the prep work constitutes a self-contained introductory course in programming,
giving you skills that you will be able to apply to other parts of your life.


## Ruby Setup

If you've already setup ruby, you may skip this section. Otherwise,
please see the [setup instructions][setup] document.

**Note**: The homework problems **will not** be found on Codeacademy - you
**must** setup the web based ruby development environment.

[setup]: ../coding-test-1/setup.md

# Required homework

First, do the [required readings][readings].

Please work on and submit these exercises before you arrive
(submission details are below). **These are required**; we want you to
be ready for class when it starts.

[readings]: ./readings.md

## Due-date (Only relevant for accepted students)

Test-First Ruby and Event Manager are due 3 weeks before your cycle
begins. The Twitter clone is due the Friday before your cycle begins.

## Test-First Ruby (Alex Chaffee)

[Test-First Ruby][test-first-ruby] is a great way to test your Ruby
knowledge. It gives you interactive feedback, so you can find and
correct mistakes. It will also give you practice running RSpec tests
(complete level 1 of [CodeSchool's RSpec course][codeschool-rspec] if
you need a refresher on RSpec).

[test-first-ruby]: https://github.com/appacademy/test-first-ruby
[codeschool-rspec]: http://rspec.codeschool.com/levels/1

The required exercises are 0-12 and 14. To begin work, go to the
github page and click to download the ZIP file. Extract the ZIP and
open the contained README.md. This will contain further instructions
as to how to proceed.

When you're finished with Test First Ruby, send it to us (instructions
below).

### Errata

**NB: the `rake` task will not work if you save it to a directory path
that includes a space**. For instance, `/Users/FNAME LNAME/learn_ruby`
contains a space. If necessary, move the `learn_ruby` to a directory
path that doesn't contain a space.

## Rails Tutorial

**Not required if you are doing the Post-Acceptance Prepwork as part
of the application process and have not already enrolled into the
class.**

We want you to complete and turn in the
[Rails Tutorial][rails-tutorial] before starting the class. We'll
start with Ruby before moving into Rails, but we want you to have
played around with Rails a little. Following along with the tutorial,
build the Twitter clone that the book has you start in Chapter 3 (read
and follow along with the earlier chapters, too, of course) and finish
through the rest of the book.

## Event Manager (JumpstartLabs)

[Event Manager][event-manager] is a tutorial that walks you through
writing your first Ruby program. Work through the tutorial, writing
code. **Type the code yourself** instead of copy and pasting; that way
you'll remember the commands better.

You can skip the iterations at the end of the tutorial.

When you've finished building the Event Manager, send it to us
(instructions below).

[event-manager]: http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html

## Submitting Your Work

When done, please zip your Test First Ruby folder (complete with
instructions, specs, and your solutions) and mail it to us at
[admissions@appacademy.io](mailto:admissions@appacademy.io). Please also attach
your Event Manager. If you are completing this after enrolling for the class,
please send a link to your Twitter clone the Friday before your cohort begins.
