# Post-Acceptance Prepwork

Hey all! **We're super excited that soon you'll be coming to App
Academy!**

We want you to hit the ground running when you arrive; App Academy is
a fast moving course and we want you be prepared and not fall
behind. For that reason, we have compiled prepwork for you to train up
on and start to flex your Ruby muscles. **Completing the prepwork is
required**.

Students who are successful in the course start the prepwork early; we
strongly recommend that you **start it immediately after being
accepted**. Don't wait until the end to start; you need to practice as
much as you can **before** the course to maximize what you learn
**in** the course.
